# Full Stack Workshop

This repository contains various tasks and exercises completed as part of the Full Stack Workshop. Each task focuses on different aspects of web development, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end and back-end technologies.

## Task 1: HTML Basics

### Objective
In this task, I created a simple HTML webpage that includes:
- A heading using `<h1>` tag
- Two paragraphs of text using `<p>` tags
- An unordered list using `<ul>` and `<li>` tags
- An ordered list by replacing `<ul>` with `<ol>`
- An image using the `<img>` tag

### Files
- `first_page.html`: The HTML file demonstrating the use of basic HTML tags, including `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<img>`.

### Instructions to View
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `first_page.html` in a web browser to see the webpage.

## Task 2: JavaScript Multiplication and Division

### Objective
In this task, I created a JavaScript program to perform multiplication and division of two numbers. The program takes two user inputs and outputs the results of their multiplication and division.

### Files
- `multiplication_division.js`: The JavaScript file containing the program for performing multiplication and division.

### Instructions to View
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `multiplication_division.js` in any text editor or IDE.
